# Powerball Analysis

**Hands-on tinkering with real Powerball data to learn Python workflows and analysis basics.**

## Goals
- Practice Python on a real dataset
- Explore basic data cleaning and workflow design
- Try out simple analysis and visualization

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas (data handling)
- matplotlib / seaborn (visualization)
- NumPy (basic calculations)

## What This Project Does
- Loads Powerball historical data
- Cleans and organizes the dataset
- Runs simple statistical summaries (frequency counts, averages, etc.)
- Generates basic plots to visualize patterns

## Notes
This is a **curiosity-driven project**, not intended as a polished data science portfolio piece. The focus is on learning Python workflows and experimenting with real-world data.
